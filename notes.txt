###Notes for things related to writing the proposal. 

#TODO 
    #

#Questions? 
    #how to accomate for pure bulge , pure disk datacubes having different dimensions than bulge+disk?
        ##what if make all of them same size ---> have to look for exact parts where it conflicts. 

#output.py 
    #notice in the header line 60 we have a field called nslices - represent number of images in each extension of the fits file. 
    #line 75 checks if the second extension in the fits file (fits[1]) is a table and then makes the hdu offset increase by 1 
        so that it starts loading image in the fits[2] which as showed in test1 ipython notebook is 

#model.py 
    #

#render. py 
    # line 234- were partials are calculated and ncubes established is a good place to start changing. 
    #

#analysis.py 
    #check if line 489 is important to change for more parameters?? 
    #the analyzer collects each of the stamps produced at each step with render_galaxy(galaxy) and at the end has a stamp for each galaxy 

#Things to consider when changing to 2nd partials adding.  
    #have to look where header is created with slices (simulate.py???)
    #gets num_slices that is stored in the line 645 of (finalyze analyzer) analysis.py so that it probably adapts to the number of partials/datacubes
        I write in render.py (because Analyzer just looks at the first stamp and looks how many partials are in it line.) 
    #this stamp object contains only the galaxy images and its partials as return by render_galaxy. 
    #probably first thing to change and experiment with is in render.py, specifically render_galaxy to change what is stored. 
    #
    #probably change function get_transformed_model() for the galaxies in model.py too.
