To Do List
==========

* Formatted survey options printout.
* Use better 8-char names and add comments to FITS headers.
* Use galtileid instead of id in dbquery (int32 -> int64).
* Use transparency for selected objects in display.

Longer-Term Projects
--------------------

* Validate galaxy input catalog quantities against existing datasets.
* Add stars from some catalog and estimate their contributions to blending statistics.
* Use PhoSim to generate realistic bright-star templates that could be used in GalSim.
* Compare GalSim and PhoSim images generated for the same catalog footprint.
