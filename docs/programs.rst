Programs
========

All available programs are contained in the top-level directory where this package is installed. Programs are written in python and use the '.py' file extension.

All programs are configured by passing command-line options. Pass the `--help` option to view documentation for these options, e.g.::

	./simulate.py --help

This document provides an introduction to each of the available programs. Examples of running the programs are :doc:`documented elsewhere </examples>`.

.. _prog-simulate:

simulate
--------

The `simulate` program simulates a weak-lensing survey by performing fast image rendering with `galsim <https://github.com/GalSim-developers/GalSim>`_.

The program reads a :doc:`catalog of astronomical sources </catalog>` and produces a set of :doc:`output data products </output>`.

.. _prog-display:

display
-------

The `display` program displays simulated images and analysis results stored in the FITS file generated by the `simulate` program.

.. _prog-lsst2wl:

lsst2wl
-------

Program to query the official LSST simulation galaxy catalog and write a text :doc:`catalog file </catalog>` in the format expected by the `simulate` program.  You do not normally need to run this program since suitable catalog files are already provided.
