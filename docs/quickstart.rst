Quickstart Tutorial
===================

The tutorial is in the form of a `jupyter notebook <http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.  You can either:

- `Browse the tutorial online <https://github.com/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/WeakLensingDeblending/blob/master/notebooks/TutorialIntroduction.ipynb>`_

- :doc:`Install this package<install>` and `run the notebook locally <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html>`_.

The first method is the easiest since it only requires a web browser.  The second method requires that you have python and jupyter installed, but allows you to make changes to the tutorial and experiment.
