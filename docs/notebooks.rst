The following `iPython notebooks <http://ipython.org/notebook.html>`_ are included in the `notebooks/` directory and can be viewed online:
 * `GalaxyCatalogPlots <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/WeakLensingDeblending/blob/master/notebooks/GalaxyCatalogPlots.ipynb>`_: Plots of galaxy catalog quantities.
 * `OutputCatalogPlots <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/WeakLensingDeblending/blob/master/notebooks/OutputCatalogPlots.ipynb>`_: Plots of simulation output catalog quantities.
 * `Figures <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/WeakLensingDeblending/blob/master/notebooks/Figures.ipynb>`_: Figures for documenting the package.
 * `Source Extractor Comparisons <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/DarkEnergyScienceCollaboration/WeakLensingDeblending/blob/master/notebooks/SEXtractorComparisons.ipynb>`_: Comparisons with Source Extractor object detection.

You can also edit and run these notebooks locally if you have ipython installed. First `start the server <http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/stable/notebook/notebook.html#starting-the-notebook-server>`_ in its own window (where it log messages will appear)::
